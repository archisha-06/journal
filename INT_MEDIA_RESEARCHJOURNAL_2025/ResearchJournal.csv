left,Gayane Yerkanyan,Typographic Poster Series Errors. ,"Autonomy creates errors. Errors are free. They cannot be described and filled. They do not need to belong. They have space for emptiness, pauses and silence. Sound stops being a part of musical form. Sound has the beauty of its own and can exist on its own. Words not always need context, they can exist and tell things by themselves. Letters do not have to construct words anymore…they become autonomous and may develop into newer forms of being, become something else and not to belong to anything.

leftDoubleImage,Can Yang,Can Yang talks us through her practice of “Neobridging” ahead of her RCA grad show,"Can has coined her practice Neobridging, “a speculative hypothesis of structuring new forms of practice through integrating layers and hybridising discursive polysemiotic dimensions,"" she says. ""In building this model of art practice, which serves as a linkage from artist to artwork and artwork to an audience, my research is centred in promoting two values: multi-dimensionality and complexity.” Multi-dimensionality is an approach to criticism and involves “discovering, recognising and understanding the higher dimensions — the unseen, underlying, unspoken and implicit assumptions, ideas and frameworks of cultural forms.” The complexity part, on the other hand, references the mode through which Can’s work reaches its audience. “In comparison to the linear way of transferring a message from artist through artwork to the audience, the Neobridge model aims to deconstruct the determinacy and primacy of the work of art, that a linear thinking process of visual representation could be alternatively substituted with net-like discursive ‘bridges’.”",https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/5o5DnO1Q42ZQ9I0cSwHD4JPdgpM=/208221/format-webp%7Cwidth-2880/can-yang-graphic-design-art-itsnicethat-8.jpg,https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/wKyQSNy4e40zJAeny7m6DGO_cRg=/208218/format-webp%7Cwidth-2880/can-yang-graphic-design-art-itsnicethat-5.jpg,Can Yang: Form-bridging Independent Process overview,"Can Yang: Form-bridging Collaborative Workshop, poster",https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/can-yang-neobridging-graphic-design-art-180621," Form-bridging, Digital print, Experiments",

leftDoubleImage,"TeamLab, 2017",Moving Creates Vortices and Vortices Create Movement,"When a person moves, a flow is born, and that flow creates an influence that extends far and wide. The movement of other people will likewise create a flow, coming together and creating a vortex. 
When people stop, or if people leave the space, the flow will eventually disappear and nothing will exist in the space.

The flow in the artwork is expressed as a continuum of particles, and lines are drawn in  three-dimensional space according to the trajectories of those particles. The accumulation of lines that represent the work are then flattened according to what teamLab calls Ultrasubjective Space.

Each particle releases an extremely brief tone when it moves. Through the movement of many particles, the tones turn into continuous music.

This artwork was commissioned by the National Gallery of Victoria and is part of the museum’s permanent collection. It was also exhibited in the first NGV Triennial (2017-2018).",https://team-lab.imagewave.pictures/npBGVXw9FMDcuZLCWCCPUb?width=1920&quality=30,https://team-lab.imagewave.pictures/F6VfgSFnh7fPy7FT2na4NS?width=1920&quality=30,,,https://www.teamlab.art/w/vortices/ngv-triennial/,"3D, Movement, Particles",
leftDoubleImage,Jamie Zigelbaum,SIX-FORTY BY FOUR-EIGHTY,"Six-Forty by Four-Eighty is an interactive lighting installation composed of an array of magnetic, physical pixels. Individually, pixel-tiles change their color in response to touch and communicate their state to each other by using a person's body as the conduit for information. When grouped together, the pixel-tiles create patterns and animations that can serve as a tool for customizing our physical spaces. By transposing the pixel from the confines of the screen and into the physical world, focus is drawn to the materiality of computation and new forms for design emerge.

There's also a Silk app that you can download for your ipad or iphone. It's simple to use- just drag your cursor around the screen to draw, and watch the ribbons of ""silk"" appear on both sides of the screen in a symmetrical formation. The more silk you add to a section of the drawing, the brighter that area will get. I love to draw with Silk whenever I need a brain-break from working or running errands.
